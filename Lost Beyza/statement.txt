//TODO: create statement
There is a labyrinth where you can move from section to section through doors. In every section, there are three doors: the first leads to the section before, the second to triple the current section, and the last to the next section plus four. Additionally, in each even section, there's an extra door that's free and leads to half of the current section. There is only one exit at the section $m$. There is no door numbered smaller than $0$.

Beyza somehow found herself in the labyrinth and wants to get out. She looks around and sees that she is at section $n$. What is the minimum number of doors she needs to go through to get out of the labyrinth?


//TODO: input format
two space seperated integers $n$ and $m$ — start and end sections respectively

//TODO: output format
one integer — the minimum number of doors Beyza needs to go through to get out of the labyrinth.

//TODO: constraints
* $1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$
* $1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$
